Student Portfolio Project

This repository contains my portfolio website which I designed, prototyped, and wrote the code for 
to present a quick view summary of my current abilities as a UI/UX designer and developer.

The webpage features a stcky navbar, introduction header with a video background, sticky contact page, "About" section detailing who I am and a little of my expereince, and two sections, Design & GitHub,
that detail a few projects I've worked on and a link to my GitHub.

For this project, I used th languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
